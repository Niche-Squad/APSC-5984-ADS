    "\n",
    "In this note, we will continue our discussion on OOP. This note will cover the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism. And we will work on a simple example to demonstrate all the OOP concepts we have learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a recap of the OOP principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction**: Generalization of a concept (e.g., car). The ability to focus on the essential characteristics of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**: Protecting the data or methods from the outside world (e.g.,using a hood of the car). Hiding the implementation details from the user (e.g., how the engine works), only the functionality (e.g., steering wheel) will be provided to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: The ability to define a new class with little or no modification to an existing class (e.g., a new car model).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: The ability to operate on different data types using the same interface. For example, a car can be a sedan, a truck, or a sport car, but they all can be operated using a steering wheel.\n"

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a way to form classes that are derived upon existing classes. The derived class inherits the features from the base class and can have additional features of its own. For example, we can define a class called `Car` and then define more specific classes like `Sedan`, `Truck`, and `SportCar` that inherit the properties of the `Car` class. Remember that the abstract class \"Animal\" we defined in the previous note? We can define more specific classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird` that inherit the properties of the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, inheritance works by passing the parent class as an argument to the definition of a child class. Let's use the bank account as an example."
